## Validate a variable

In the NSFG dataset, the variable `'outcome'` encodes the outcome of each pregnancy as shown below:

| Value | Label             |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1     | Live birth        |
| 2     | Induced abortion  |
| 3     | Stillbirth        |
| 4     | Miscarrieage      |
| 5     | Ectopic pregnancy |
| 6     | Current pregnancy |

The `nsfg` DataFrame has been pre-loaded for you. Explore it in the IPython Shell and use the methods Allen showed you in the video to answer the following question: How many pregnancies in this dataset ended with a live birth?
