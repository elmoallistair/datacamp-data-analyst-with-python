# Onboarding | Errors

If you submit the code to the right, you'll see that you get two types of errors.

*SQL* errors are shown below the editor. These are errors returned by the *SQL* engine. You should see:

> syntax error at or near "'DataCamp <3 SQL'" LINE 2: 'DataCamp <3 SQL' ^

*DataCamp* errors are shown in the **Instructions** box. These will let you know in plain English where you went wrong in your code! You should see:

> You need to add SELECT at the start of line 2!
