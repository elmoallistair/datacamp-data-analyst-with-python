# Beginning your SQL journey

Now that you're familiar with the interface, let's get straight into it.

SQL, which stands for *Structured Query Language*, is a language for interacting with data stored in something called a *relational database*.

You can think of a relational database as a collection of tables. A table is just a set of rows and columns, like a spreadsheet, which represents exactly one type of entity. For example, a table might represent employees in a company or purchases made, but not both.

Each row, or *record*, of a table contains information about a single entity. For example, in a table representing employees, each row represents a single person. Each column, or *field*, of a table contains a single attribute for all rows in the table. For example, in a table representing employees, we might have a column containing first and last names for all employees.

The table of employees might look something like this:

| id | name    | age | nationaly |
|----|---------|-----|-----------|
| 1  | Jessica | 22  | Ireland   |
| 2  | Gabriel | 48  | France    |
| 3  | Laura   | 36  | USA       |
