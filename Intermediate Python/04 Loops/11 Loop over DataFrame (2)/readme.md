## Loop over DataFrame (2)

The row data that's generated by `iterrows()` on every run is a Pandas Series. This format is not very convenient to print out. Luckily, you can easily select variables from the Pandas Series using square brackets:

> for lab, row in brics.iterrows() :
>     print(row['country'])

<hr>

**Instructions**
* Using the iterators `lab` and `row`, adapt the code in the for loop such that the first iteration prints out `"US: 809"`, the second iteration `"AUS: 731"`, and so on.
* The output should be in the form `"country: cars_per_cap"`. Make sure to print out this exact string (with the correct spacing).
    * *You can use `str()` to convert your integer data to a string so that you can print it in conjunction with the country label.*

## Script
```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Adapt for loop
for lab, row in cars.iterrows() :
    print('{}: {}'.format(lab, row['cars_per_cap']))
```

## Output
```
<script.py> output:
    US: 809
    AUS: 731
    JPN: 588
    IN: 18
    RU: 200
    MOR: 70
    EG: 45
