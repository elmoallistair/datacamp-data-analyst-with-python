## How low can you go?

Things are shaping up nicely! You already have code that calculates your location in the Empire State Building after 100 dice throws. However, there's something we haven't thought about - you can't go below 0!

A typical way to solve problems like this is by using `max()`. If you pass `max()` two arguments, the biggest one gets returned. For example, to make sure that a variable `x` never goes below `10` when you decrease it, you can use:

> `x = max(10, x - 1)`

**Instructions**

* Use **max()** in a similar way to make sure that **step** doesn't go below zero if **dice <= 2**.
* Hit *Submit Answer* and check the contents of **random_walk**.

## Script
```
# Numpy is imported, seed is set

# Initialize random_walk
random_walk = [0]

for x in range(100) :
    step = random_walk[-1]
    dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

    if dice <= 2:
        # Replace below: use max to make sure step can't go below 0
        step = max(0, step-1)
    elif dice <= 5:
        step = step + 1
    else:
        step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

    random_walk.append(step)

print(random_walk)
```

## Output
```
<script.py> output:
    [0, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 6, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 11, 15, 16, 15, 16, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 33, 34, 38, 39, 38, 39, 40, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 44, 43, 44, 45, 44, 43, 44, 45, 47, 46, 45, 46, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 53, 52, 53, 52, 53, 54, 53, 56, 57, 58, 59, 58, 59, 60]
