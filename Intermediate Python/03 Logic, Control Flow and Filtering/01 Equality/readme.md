## Equality

To check if two Python values, or variables, are equal you can use `==.` To check for inequality, you need `!=`. As a refresher, have a look at the following examples that all result in `True`. Feel free to try them out in the IPython Shell.

> ```
> 2 == (1 + 1)
> "intermediate" != "python"
> True != False
> "Python" != "python"
> ```

When you write these comparisons in a script, you will need to wrap a `print()` function around them to see the output.

**Instructions**
* In the editor on the right, write code to see if `True` equals `False`.
* Write Python code to check if `-5 * 15` is *not* equal to `75`.
* Ask Python whether the strings `"pyscript"` and `"PyScript"` are equal.
* What happens if you compare booleans and integers? Write code to see if `True` and `1` are equal.

## Script
```
# Comparison of booleans
True == False

# Comparison of integers
-5 * 15 != 75

# Comparison of strings
'pyscript' == 'PyScript'

# Compare a boolean with an integer
True == 1
```
