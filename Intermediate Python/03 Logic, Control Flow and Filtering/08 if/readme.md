## if

It's time to take a closer look around in your house.

Two variables are defined in the sample code: `room`, a string that tells you which room of the house we're looking at, and `area`, the area of that room.

<hr>

**Instructions**
* Examine the `if` statement that prints out `"Looking around in the kitchen."` if `room` equals "kit".
* Write another `if` statement that prints out `"big place!"` if `area` is greater than 15.

## Script
```
# Define variables
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

# if statement for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")

# if statement for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
```

## Output
```
<script.py> output:
    looking around in the kitchen.
```
