## Cars per capita (2)

Remember about `np.logical_and()`, `np.logical_or()` and `np.logical_not()`, the Numpy variants of the `and`, `or` and `not` operators? You can also use them on Pandas Series to do more advanced filtering operations.

Take this example that selects the observations that have a `cars_per_cap` between 10 and 80. Try out these lines of code step by step to see what's happening.

> ```
> cpc = cars['cars_per_cap']
> between = np.logical_and(cpc > 10, cpc < 80)
> medium = cars[between]
> ```

**Instructions**
* Use the code sample above to create a DataFrame `medium`, that includes all the observations of `cars` that have a `cars_per_cap` between `100` and `500`.
* Print out `medium`.

## Script
```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Import numpy, you'll need this
import numpy as np

# Create medium: observations with cars_per_cap between 100 and 500
cpc = cars['cars_per_cap']
between = np.logical_and(cpc > 100, cpc < 500)
medium = cars[between]

# Print medium
print(medium)
```

## Output
```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Import numpy, you'll need this
import numpy as np

# Create medium: observations with cars_per_cap between 100 and 500
cpc = cars['cars_per_cap']
between = np.logical_and(cpc > 100, cpc < 500)
medium = cars[between]

# Print medium
print(medium)
```
