## Warmup

To experiment with `if` and `else` a bit, have a look at this code sample:

> ```
> area = 10.0
> if(area < 9) :
>     print("small")
> elif(area < 12) :
>     print("medium")
> else :
>     print("large")
> ```

What will the output be if you run this piece of code in the IPython Shell?
