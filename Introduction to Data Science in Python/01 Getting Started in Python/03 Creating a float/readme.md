## Creating a float

Before we start looking for Bayes' kidnapper, we need to fill out a Missing Puppy Report with details of the case. Each piece of information will be stored as a variable.

We define a variable using an equals sign (`=`). For instance, we would define the variable height:

> height = 24

In this exercise, we'll be defining `bayes_age` to be `4.0` months old. The data type for this variable will be *float*, meaning that it is a number.

<hr>

**Instructions**
* Define a variable called `bayes_age` and set it equal to `4.0`.
* Display the variable `bayes_age`.

## Script
```
# Fill in Bayes' age (4.0)
bayes_age = 4.0

# Display the variable bayes_age
print(bayes_age)
```

## Output
```

    Mr. Squeaky
