## Creating strings

Let's continue to fill out the Missing Puppy Report for Bayes. In the previous exercise, we defined `bayes_age`, which was a *float*, which represents a number.

In this exercise, we'll define `favorite_toy` and owner, which will both be *strings*. A *string* represents text. A *string* is surrounded by quotation marks (`'` or `"`) and can contain letters, numbers, and special characters. It doesn't matter if you use single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes, but it's important to be consistent throughout your code.

**Instructions**
* Define a variable called favorite_toy whose value is "Mr. Squeaky".
* Define a variable called owner whose value is 'DataCamp'.
* Show the values assigned to these variables.

## Script

# Bayes' favorite toy
favorite_toy = 'Mr. Squeaky'

# Bayes' owner
owner = 'DataCamp'

# Display variables
print(favorite_toy)
print(owner)
```

## Output
```
<script.py> output:
    Mr. Squeaky
