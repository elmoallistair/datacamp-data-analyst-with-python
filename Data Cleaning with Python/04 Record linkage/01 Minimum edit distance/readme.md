## Minimum edit distance

In the video exercise, you saw how minimum edit distance is used to identify how similar two strings are. As a reminder, minimum edit distance is the <u>minimum number of steps</u> needed to reach from ***String A*** to ***String B***, with the operations available being:

* **Insertion** of a new character.
* **Deletion** of an existing character.
* **Substitution** of an existing character.
* **Transposition** of two existing consecutive characters.

<hr>

*What is the minimum edit distance from '`sign'` to `'sing'`, and which operation(s) gets you there?*

**Possible Answers**

* 2 by substituting `'g'` with `'n'` and `'n'` with `'g'`.
* 1 by transposing `'g'` with `'n'`.
* 1 by substituting `'g'` with `'n'`.
* 2 by deleting `'g'` and inserting a new `'g'` at the end.

**Answer**

> 1 by transposing `'g'` with `'n'`.
